Ok, I know that I should have already cabalized Hephaestus. 

But I didn't have enough time after I concluded my thesis. This activity 
was postponed to a near future (I hope). 

Until there, Hephaestus was successfully compiled using:

* GHC-7.4.1
* Haskell platform

External dependencies:

    * bimap-0.2
    * bitset-1.4.0
    * cairo-0.12.4
    * funsat-0.6.2
    * gio-0.12.4
    * glade-0.12.1
    * glib-0.12.4
    * gtk-0.12.4
    * hxt-9.3.1.1
    * hxt-charproperties-9.1.1
    * hxt-regex-xmlschema-9.1.0
    * hxt-relaxng-9.1.4
    * hxt-unicode-9.0.2
    * network-2.4.1.2
    * pango-0.12.4
    * parse-dimacs-1.2

It is important to note that, after installing the Haskell Platform, we 
could easly install these dependencies using caball install. Only the following 
*top level* packages have to be installed. So, try this:

     $ cabal install bimap-0.2
     $ cabal install bitset-1.4.0
     $ parse-dimacs-1.2

     $ git clone git@github.com:rbonifacio/funsat.git
     $ cd funsat
     $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
     $ runhaskell Setup.hs build --user
     $ runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

     $ cabal install hxt
     $ cabal install hxt-relaxng

Testando commit

It is also necessary to install gtk2hs into your system. See the 
following link for further details:

* http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gtk2Hs 

Recent versions of gtk2hs have also been cabalized. So, you might also be able 
to install gtk2hs (and related tools) using the following sequence of 
commands

$ cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
$ export PATH=$PATH:$USER_HOME/.cabal/bin

$ cabal install glib
$ cabal install gtk
$ cabal install glade

After resolving all dependencies, you could build Hephaestus by running 
the compile script (see the main folder).

Enjoy!!!
