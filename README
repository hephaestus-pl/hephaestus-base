Ok, I know that I should have already cabalized Hephaestus. 

But I didn't have enough time after I concluded my thesis. This activity 
was postponed to a near future (I hope). 

Until there, Hephaestus was successfully compiled using:

* GHC-6.12.3
* Haskell platform

External dependencies:

* QuickCheck-1.2.0.1
* bimap-0.2.4
* binary-0.5.0.2
* bitset-0.6
* funsat-0.6.0
* hxt-9.0.1
* hxt-charproperties-9.0.0
* hxt-regex-xmlschema-9.0.0
* hxt-unicode-9.0.0
* parse-dimacs-1.2
* parsec-3.1.0

It is important to note that, after installing the Haskell Platform, we 
could easly install these dependencies using caball install. Only the following 
*top level* packages have to be installed. So, try this:

$ cabal install funsat-0.6.0
$ cabal install hxt
$ cabal install hxt-relaxng

It is also necessary to install gtk2hs into your system. See the 
following link for further details:

* http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gtk2Hs 

Recent versions of gtk2hs have also been cabalized. So, you might be able 
to install gtk2hs (and related tools) using the following sequence of 
commands

$ cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
$ cabal install glib
$ cabal install gtk
$ cabal install glade

After resolving all dependencies, you could build Hephaestus by running 
the compile script (see the main folder).

Enjoy!!!
